# Bit-Manipulation

### 1. Bit Insertion

You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
Write a method to insert Minto N such that Mstarts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i= 2, because Mcould not fully ft between bit 3 and bit 2.

```
   Input : 10000000000, 10011, 2, 6
   Output : 10001001100
```

This question is from Cracking Coding Interview 6th Edition, but the posted solution is my solution.


### 2. Fraction Binary To String

Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double,
print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print"ERROR:'

```
   Input : 0.625
   Output : 0.101 (binary)
```

### 3. Logical Right Shift in Python

Since there is no built-in Logical Right Shift operator ('>>>'), make a function for it.

```
   Input : 1111, 1
   Output : 0111
```

### 4. Two different ways of counting # of 1's that are different between A and B

```
   Input : 1111, 1011
   Output : 1

   Input : 11011001, 10111000
   Output : 3
```

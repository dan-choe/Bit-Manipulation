# Bit-Manipulation

### 1. Bit Insertion

You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
Write a method to insert Minto N such that Mstarts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i= 2, because Mcould not fully ft between bit 3 and bit 2.

This question is from Cracking Coding Interview 6th Edition, but the posted solution is my solution.
